# Stitch Fix Build Infrastructure Team Take Home Exercise
Greetings!

Thank you for taking the next steps along the hiring journey with us at Stitch Fix!

The purpose of this exercise is to get your feedback, ideas, approaches to technical problems we identify to likely happen within the course of day-to-day work here on the team. We will review your responses, and use this to drive discussion with the team during the OnSite Interview.

We identify and recognize that this engagement is happening in your time. Because of this, we have scoped this exercise to 1 hour to complete. It is completely ok if the exercise is "incomplete", as we can discuss further in the OnSite.

There are two parts to this interview: [questions](QUESTIONS.md) and [code](CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md). To answer the questions, please answer the questions in the [questions](QUESTIONS.md) file, commit your answers as changes, and open a PR. To solve the code portion, please follow the directions in the [code instructions](CODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

If you have any questions, comments, or other feedback, please reach out - brenna.flood@stitchfix.com

Good luck and have fun, The Build Infrastucture Team.
